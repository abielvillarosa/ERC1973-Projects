# Project Name: Stro (Tiered Loyalty Program)

# Authors and Github username: Abiel Villarosa (@abielvillarosa)

# Description of the Project 

A decentralized application that incentivizes customers with ERC20 tokens (Stro coins) who opt out on using straws (stamping) when buying beverages from food establishments. These tokens can be later be used to redeem specific food/drink products on the food establishments catalogue.

As customers accumulate enough Stro coins, they will reach specific levels where the higher their level, the more discount of Stro coins they will have when redeeming for products. 

| Tier Loyalty Level | Number of Stamping earned | Stro coins reward discount on each redemption |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bronze |  > 50 | 3 % |
| Silver | > 75 | 5 % | 
| Gold | > 100| 10 % |


# Problem specification related to ERC 1973

Participating customers who have earned enough Stro coins through stamping will be rewarded with a discount when they make a redemption of food products using their earned Stro coins.

# Solution in relation to ERC 1973 

Application of ERC 1973 allows ERC20 reward distribution in a scalable manner to all the partcipating customers based on their tier level. The discount will be handled by the application giving them extra stro coins when making the redemption.
