Harvest enables the farmers to reach out directly to potential investors. This eliminates the middle man, the banks and local lenders, helping the farmers to solicit the funds easily and on a timely manner. With the availability of the funds, farmers are able to follow the proper planting and harvesting cycles utilizing the resources efficiently and reaping the maximum possible profits.
Every time the farmer havest the crops and the profits are realized, the profits will be in the form of minted tokens whil will be distributed to the investors. When investors, pulls out their investment, the total amount including the shares of the profit for every harvesting cycle they are included will comprise the total withdrawal amount.
