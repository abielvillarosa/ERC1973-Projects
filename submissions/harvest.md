# Project Name: Harvest

# Authors and Github username: Abiel Villarosa (@abielvillarosa)

# Description of the Project 

A decentralized application that provides a real life Farmville experience to investors while providing funding support to the farmers using Ethereum Smart Contracts 

Harvest enables the farmers to reach out directly to potential investors. This eliminates the middle man, the banks and local lenders, helping the farmers to solicit the funds easily and on a timely manner. With the availability of the funds, farmers are able to follow the proper planting and harvesting cycles utilizing the resources efficiently and reaping the maximum possible profits.
The funding will follow a tiered approach where investors who have reached a specific level of investments as per the table below will have additional share of profits, in form of ERC20 tokens also, once the the rewards are distributed.

| Tier Level | Investment % Range | Additional % Reward |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | 81-100 % | 5 % |
| 4 | 61-80 % | 3 % | 
| 3 | 41-60 %| 2 % |
| 2 | 21-40 % | 1 % | 
| 1 | 0-20 % | 0 % |
