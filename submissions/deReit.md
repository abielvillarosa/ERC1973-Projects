# Project Name: Decentralized REIT

# Authors and Github username: Abiel Villarosa (@abielvillarosa)

# Description of the Project 

A decentralized REIT application enables investors to own shares of real estate properties similar to REIT. These shares will be represented by ERC 20 tokens. 

# Problem specification related to ERC 1973

The number of investors and the number of shares owned by an investor varies throughout the whole operation of the REIT. The distribution of the dividends to the investors based on their share pose some challenge on the application as this will require an accurate computation of the total gains from the operation distributed over the number of investors/shares for a given time period.

# Solution in relation to ERC 1973 

Application of ERC 1973 allows ERC20 reward distribution in a scalable manner to all the participating investors throughout the operation. When the investor withdraws his share and converts to actual money, the total investments including the gains from the operation where the investor is a part of will be automaticall computed and given to the investor.
